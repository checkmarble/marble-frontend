This is a monorepo TypeScript project using **pnpm** as the package manager. The project follows a modular architecture with distinct packages for different concerns.
- **pnpm** - Used for dependency management and workspace coordination

## Key Packages

### `app-builder`
- **Purpose**: Main web application
- **Technology**: Remix (React-based full-stack framework)
- **Role**: Primary user interface and application logic

### `marble-api`
- **Purpose**: OpenAPI specification for backend APIs
- **Role**: API contract definitions and type generation
- **Note**: Backend implementation is maintained in a separate repository

### `ui-design-system`
- **Purpose**: Design system components
- **Contents**: Collection of atomic and molecular UI components
- **Role**: Provides consistent UI primitives across the application

### `ui-icons`
- **Purpose**: Icon collection
- **Role**: Centralized icon assets and components

## Development Commands

### Type Checking
```bash
pnpm -r type-check
```
- Runs TypeScript type checking across all packages in the workspace
- The `-r` flag executes the command recursively across all workspace packages

### Linting and Formatting
```bash
pnpm biome check
```
- Runs Biome for both linting and formatting checks
- Biome is a fast linter and formatter for JavaScript/TypeScript

## Architecture Notes
- Monorepo structure enables shared tooling and dependencies
- Each package has its own `package.json` and can be developed independently
- Workspace configuration allows for cross-package dependencies
- Consistent tooling (TypeScript, Biome) across all packages
